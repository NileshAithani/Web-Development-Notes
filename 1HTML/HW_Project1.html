        <h3>About...</h3>
        <pre>
            I am a Web Developer currently working as a freelancer 
            from my home in Uttrakhand. I love designing and building 
            beautiful UI and application for the internet,
            Also if i've to choose one, I'll frontend over backend any
            day because lets be honest, it's way more fun! I am also intrigued
            by technology and puzzles. Thats why I decided to become a programmer
            as it helps me exercise my brain.
            In my free time I love Playing Basketball,working out,
            reading books and explore the nearby places. Also loves 
            travelling and wanted to travel more in 2023 as it was one 
            of my new year resolution for 2023.
            Once a speedcuber(people who solve that shit like really fast),
            now it's just a means to relax. Not to brag but I was once in top
            100 in India :).
            I know you must be thinking "Such a nerd". Just don't!!
